## building
To build a gba file for a gameboy run
```
./build.sh
```

this produces a game_emu.gba and a game.gba.
The game_emu.gab runs on an emulater, the game.gba runs on a real gameboy, for example with an [ezflalsh omega](https://www.ezflash.cn/product/omega/).

For some reason i could not get one gba to work on both.
